# Module-5

This application allows the user to login and register using Firebase.
The user will be able to view the reviews of the company - Each review, including the username of the reviewer is retrieved from a dataset from Firestore and displayed in the app.

Once the user has login or registered, they will be able to view a catalogue of phones. 
The user will be able to select a phone and a map will appear which will show stores that have the selected phone in-stock for the user to purchase.
(Please note that the map will not appear in the apk due to a google api key being required, however it should work just fine in an android emulator)

The user will be able to view the profile page which contains their relevant details.
